Resolving a conflict doesn't automatically merge the pull request in GitHub. Instead, it stores the resolution of the conflict in a merge commit and allows you and your team to keep working. 
To resolve a conflict, GitHub performs what is known as a reverse merge. This means that the changes from the main branch were merged into your my-resume branch. 
With a reverse merge, only the my-resume branch is updated. This allows you to test the resolved changes on your branch before you merge it into main.
